## üìç Overview

The Loyalty Points Project in Python is a codebase that implements a loyalty program management system with the Temporal SDK. It provides a Flask application with REST API endpoints for managing loyalty points, such as adding or removing points and sending emails. The project utilizes the Temporal workflow engine to handle program logic, ensuring efficient and reliable execution. With its robust functionality and modular design, the Loyalty Points Project offers a valuable solution for businesses looking to implement and manage their loyalty programs effectively.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a microservices architecture pattern, where different components handle specific functionalities. The Flask application (`app.py`) serves as the frontend, providing REST API endpoints for managing the loyalty program. The LoyaltyProgram workflow (`loyalty_workflow.py`) implements the program logic, including point management and email sending. The worker (`main.py`) listens to a task queue and runs the LoyaltyProgram workflow and the send_email activity. The codebase uses the Temporal workflow engine to handle the program logic efficiently. The architecture allows for scalability and modularity, with each component responsible for a specific task.|
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The codebase lacks comprehensive documentation. Although some files have docstrings explaining their purpose, there is a lack of high-level documentation, architectural overview, and usage instructions. Improving the documentation would make it easier for developers to understand the codebase and contribute to the project.|
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on several external libraries and systems. Notable dependencies include Flask for building the REST API, Temporal as the workflow engine, and Redis for task queue management. The codebase also relies on the standard Python libraries such as os, requests, and json. The dependencies are managed using Pipenv, as seen in the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files.|
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase demonstrates a reasonable level of modularity. Each file serves a specific purpose, such as defining data classes, implementing workflows, or managing the worker. The codebase follows a logical separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain and extend. However, there is room for improvement in organizing the code into more granular and interchangeable components, promoting reusability and maintainability.|
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The codebase does not have comprehensive test coverage. There are no specific test files or test folders present. Implementing tests using a testing framework like pytest or unittest would help ensure the correctness of the codebase and facilitate future development. The lack of testing strategies and tools poses a risk to the stability and reliability of the project.|
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | The codebase does not have any performance optimizations explicitly implemented. However, the usage of the Temporal workflow engine can improve efficiency by handling the program logic in a distributed manner. The codebase does not exhibit any resource-intensive operations or performance bottlenecks. Proper profiling and optimization techniques can be applied if performance becomes a concern in the future.|
| **üîê Security**        | The codebase does not explicitly demonstrate security measures. However, since it utilizes Flask, it can leverage Flask's security features such as protecting against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (

| [aaron.py](https://github.com/rachfop/loyalty-points-project-python/blob/main/scripts/aaron.py)   | The code snippet utilizes the "os" module to make 124 POST requests to a local API endpoint, each with a different value for the "i" parameter in the URL. The requests use the "curl" command to send a POST request with a fixed payload of 500 points. |
| [script.py](https://github.com/rachfop/loyalty-points-project-python/blob/main/scripts/script.py) | The code snippet uses the os module to make HTTP POST requests to a local server. It iterates from 1 to 124, sending requests to increment points for each iteration. Each request adds 100 points to the specified endpoint.                             |
